# a is a variable storing 5 in it.
# b is a variable storing 8 in it.
# c is a variable storing 5 in it.

a = 5
b = 8
c = 5


# if a is smaller than b and b is bigger than c print out (5 is smaller than 8 and 8 is bigger than 5)
if a < b > c:
    print("5 is smaller than 8 and 8 is bigger than 5")

# It works!
